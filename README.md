# CSDNet-CSWV
We present a convolutional neural network named CSD-Net for detecting clouds and snow. Additionally, a high-resolution cloud and snow data set named CSWV was created and published.


The code of CSD-Net can be available on the "master" branches. 


The CSWV data set can be available online at ï¼šhttps://pan.baidu.com/s/1leXQyRLqCmJOib4we5z5Ww The extraction code will be published after the article is accepted.
