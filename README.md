### CSD-Net

+ &ensp; &ensp; In our work,  a convolutional neural network named ***CSD-Net*** ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€was proposed for cloud and snow detection in medium- and high-resolution satellite images of distinct sensors.

### Requirements
+ Python 3.7
+ Pytorch 1.8+ & CUDA&CUDNN with corresponding version

### Setup
+ Clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/zhanggb1997/CSDNet-CSWV.git
```

### CSWV


+ &ensp; &ensp; Additionally , a novel high-resolution cloud and snow dataset (***CSWV***) was created and released. It contains two sub-datasets: the submeter-level high-resolution cloud and snow dataset (***CSWV_S6***) comprises six scenes with a resolution of 0.5 m; the meter- level high-resolution cloud and snow dataset (***CSWV_M21***) includes 21 resampled scenes with a resolution of 1â€“10 m.
